# todo

- don't pass raw user-name in URL for PUT/DELETE
  - short-term fix: done, handling `/` as special case
  - long-term fix: either use body or introduce user_id
- add way of choosing/highlighting a date (secret input like keyboard + mouse?)
- add hard-coded, event-type-specific times
- add instructions to email
- add free-edit text subtitle to each event for customization?
