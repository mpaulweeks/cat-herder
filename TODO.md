# todo

- don't pass user-name in URL for PUT/DELETE
  - seems to be breaking if name contains paren, or maybe single quote
  - either use body or invent user_id
- explicitly support the future
  - current week is actually current week, no special behavior for sat/sun
  - email urls include explicit link to the week
  - "Looking for last week or next week?"
- add way of choosing/highlighting a date (secret input like keyboard + mouse?)
- add hard-coded, event-type-specific times
- add instructions to email
- add free-edit text subtitle to each event for customization?
- move combined file store to one file per event-week?
